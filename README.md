# callback (Calibrated Clustering via Knockoffs) Reproducibility <img src="man/figures/callback_logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120"/>


## Introduction

We hope to make it as simple as possible to reproduce the results found in `A knockoff calibration method to avoid over-clustering in single-cell RNA-sequencing`.
To that end, we have organized our analysis scripts as a series of `R` vignettes in this repository.
